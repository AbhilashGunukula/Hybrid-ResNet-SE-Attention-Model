# Hybrid-ResNet-SE-Attention-Model

The rapid advancements in generative artificial
intelligence (AI), particularly through models like Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion-based architectures,
have made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and
synthetically generated images. While these technologies offer
benefits in creative domains, they also pose serious risks in terms
of misinformation, digital forgery, and identity manipulation.
This paper presents a novel hybrid deep learning model for
detecting AI-generated images by integrating the ResNet-50
architecture with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention blocks.
The proposed SE-ResNet50 model enhances channel-wise fea-
ture recalibration and interpretability, allowing it to focus on
subtle generative artifacts that differentiate synthetic images
from real ones. Experimental evaluation on the CIFAKE dataset
demonstrates the model’s effectiveness, achieving a test accuracy
of 96.12%, precision of 97.04%, recall of 88.94%, F1-score of
92.82%, and an AUC score of 0.9862. The model shows strong
generalization, minimal overfitting, and superior performance
compared to standard architectures like ResNet-50, VGGNet, and
DenseNet. These results confirm the hybrid model’s suitability
for real-time and resource-constrained applications in media
forensics, content authentication, and ethical AI governance.
